🌾 **AgroBot: Universal AI-Based Agriculture Assistant**
________________________________________
🔹 **Project Overview**

Agriculture plays a vital role in sustaining global economies, yet farmers often struggle with limited access to accurate and timely information about crop care, soil management, and weather conditions. AgroBot is an AI-driven agriculture assistant built to bridge this gap — providing intelligent, real-time guidance to farmers through a bilingual (English + Tamil) conversational chatbot.
This system integrates Artificial Intelligence with a Flask-based web application, offering an interactive interface where users can get answers related to crop cultivation, fertilizer use, irrigation methods, pest management, and modern farming techniques — all in one place.

🗂️ **Knowledge Base / Dataset**

Unlike numerical ML datasets, AgroBot relies on a rule-based knowledge system, mapping farming-related keywords to predefined responses.
It covers the following domains:
• 🌾 Crop management and irrigation scheduling

• 🌱 Fertilizer and pesticide selection

• ☀️ Weather patterns and soil recommendations

• 🧑‍🌾 Modern and sustainable farming methods

🔮 Future Enhancements:
•	Integration with real-time weather APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, IMD)
•	Connection to IoT-based soil moisture or temperature sensors
•	Use of ML models for crop yield prediction and pest detection
